Hi! This is my submission for Task 2 of the Data Analyst Internship.A simple and interactive sales dashboard was created using the Superstore dataset in Tableau. The dashboard includes a line chart showing monthly sales trends, a bar chart comparing sales across regions, and a donut chart displaying sales by product category. A region-based slicer was added for interactivity.

##  Key Visuals:
- Line chart: Sales over months
- Bar chart: Sales by region
- Donut chart: Sales by category
- Slicer: Region filter

  ## Sample Insights:
- West region had the highest sales
- Technology led all product categories
- Sales peaked in November and December

  ## Tools used:
  -Tableau public
  -Superstore dataset from kaggle

  Thank you for reviewing!
